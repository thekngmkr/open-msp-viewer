With these xslt files, you can convert MS Project XML files to HTML web pages.

see http://rpbouman.blogspot.com/2009/07/open-msp-viewer-free-xslt-utilities-to.html

# This Project is no longer updated #
There is a -much improved- pure HTML5 viewer for MS project files here at github: https://github.com/rpbouman/open-msp-viewer

Please use the new msp viewer from now on. Place any issue reports there, not here.
Thank you.
